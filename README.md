### 📝 Description
This project implements a **Simple Linear Regression** model to understand the relationship between a student's **CGPA** and their **Placement status**. It is designed to predict whether a student will get placed based on their academic performance.

### 🔍 How it Works
Linear Regression finds the "Line of Best Fit" through the data points. In this case, it maps:
* **Independent Variable (X):** CGPA
* **Dependent Variable (y):** Placement (Prediction)



### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
* **Model:** Linear Regression

### 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of two columns:
1. `cgpa`: The student's Grade Point Average.
2. `placement_exam_marks`: (Or your specific placement column name).
